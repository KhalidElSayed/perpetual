# Perpetual

This is Perpetual. It is "yet another music player" for the Mac.

## The Problem

I love incessantly playing music on repeat. I love incessantly playing game
music on repeat. But with game music in particular—especially those tracks
created after music was no longer "coded"—MP3s, with their raw waveforms,
just don't fit the bill. This is mainly because they don't loop "correctly,"
like they would while you're playing the game. Fade outs suck.

## The Solution

This music player strives to do _one_ thing and do it _very_ well: incessently
loop your music. Choose how many times you want to loop it, or just loop it
perpetually.

Right now, that process is manual. Eventually we hope to do it for you.

## The Backstory

It's quite simple actually:

1. Come up with the idea in the shower.
2. Rush out, sketch a version and then create a mock and throw it up on
   Dribbble (http://dribbble.com/shots/424982-Perpetual).
3. @kallepersson steps in and starts developing it while I slept.
4. Wake up to awesome.
